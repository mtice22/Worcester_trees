# Introduction

My group was tasked with creating a dashboard for the Worcester Tree Inititave (WTI). They had various tree metric data for Worcster 
Trees:
  - Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)
  - Condition of trees (Dead, Poor, Fair, Good)
  - Tree Species 
  
With this data, our responsibility was to create a dashboard that creates visualizations for the data and tying the data to mental 
health in Worcester. Our audience was local Worcester officials and visitors to the WTI website.
